## **Project Overview**
This is the backend server for the application, built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**. It follows a modular and scalable architecture with TypeScript, ensuring type safety and maintainability. The server handles **user authentication**, **CRUD operations**, and other application functionalities.

---

## **Features**
- **User Authentication**
  - JWT-based stateless authentication.
  - Secure password hashing with `bcrypt`.
- **Input Validation**
  - Using `Zod` for schema-based validation.
- **Error Handling**
  - Centralized error-handling middleware.
- **Logging**
  - Custom logging for error tracking and debugging.
- **Scalable Architecture**
  - Separation of concerns with modular controllers, services, and utilities.
- **Environment-Specific Configurations**
  - Dynamic error messages and stack traces for development and production.
- **Extensibility**
  - Designed to support additional features like rate limiting, caching, and API versioning.

---

## **Tech Stack**
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB (Mongoose for ORM)
- **Validation**: Zod
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **Environment Management**: dotenv
- **Logging**: Custom logger utility

## **Setup and Installation**

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js (v16+)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
- npm or yarn


### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the server directory:
    ```bash
    cd server
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Add a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
    ```bash
    MONGO_URI=<your_mongo_database_uri>
    JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
    NODE_ENV=development
    PORT=5000
    ```

5. To start the development server, use:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

6. For production build:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

7. To start the production server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – Start the development server using `ts-node-dev` for live reloading.
- `npm run build` – Build the project using TypeScript.
- `npm start` – Start the production server.

### Routes and Endpoints

- **POST** `/api/v1/auth/register` - Register a new user
- **POST** `/api/v1/auth/login` - Login a user
- **GET** `/api/v1/user/profile` - Get the logged-in user's profile

### Error Handling

The application uses a custom error handler for structured responses.

Example:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Invalid email or password",
  "stack": "error_stack_trace_here"
}
```

### Testing

The application does not have a direct testing setup currently, but it supports manual testing through the routes defined.

### Production Setup

For production, make sure the `.env` file contains the proper environment variables and run:
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

This will start the server in production mode.
